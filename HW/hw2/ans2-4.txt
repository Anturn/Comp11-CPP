i.      NO, definitely not. Beacause for the last part of "if``````else" 
        conditional, it's either producing a "C" or "D", it will never
        produce both of them.

j.      NO, definitely not. Because because for that part of the code which
        contains two "if" conditionals, If must go through the first "if" and 
        will produce "A" first and decide whether to continue then.
