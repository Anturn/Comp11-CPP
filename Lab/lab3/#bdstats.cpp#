/*
 * bdstats.cpp  -- compute stats on birthday data
 *
 *   SO FAR
 *	1. read in data
 *	2. then prints out the list with line numbers using another loop
 *      3. Idea: store birthdays as ints.  Example: 1031, 0704
 *
 *   TODO:
 *    [a] change loop to print out only the birthdays in October
 *    [b] after printing out the October bdays, print a count of how many
 *    [c] Move the print/count loop to a function called month_count
 *        declare the function as int month_count(int bd[], int len)
 *        The function should return the count
 *        main should call month_count
 *    [d] modify month_count so it no longer prints the dates and count
 *        and only returns the count.  Then modify main so prints the count.
 *    [e] Modify month_count so it takes a third argument: the month
 *    [f] Have main call month_count with bdays, CAPACITY, and 10
 *    [g] Now have main loop through all 12 months
 *    [h] EXTRA: print which month has the MOST birthdays
